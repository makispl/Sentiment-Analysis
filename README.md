## Introduction
James Bond is one of the longest continually-running film series in history, having been in on-going production from 1962 to the present. The upcoming movie titled as "No Time To Die" (25th instalment) goes out on April 2020 and while it is much anticipated, it may be wise (for the production) to take a census of the audience's desires and adapt the montage procedure accordingly. In this context, Sentiment Analysis could become a valuable tool...

In brief, Sentiment Analysis refers to a set of techniques used to identify and extract subjective information from a large source-dataset, usually comprised of text. The final scope is to study the "mined" material in a deep and thorough, yet comprehensive for human beings, way that may outcome considerable insights of the social sentiment upon various topics.

## Scope
This project aims to establish a basic implementation of sentiment analysis on Twitter data with Python, in order to determine the attitude of the audience upon the upcoming James Bond movie "No Time to Die", earliest referred to as #Bond25. We are going to use a series of free Python libraries (Pandas, Tweepy, TextBlob) and the Twitter API for data collection (web scraping), depicting finally a couple of data visualizations to better communicate the nuanced narrative of the findings.

## Additional Analysis
We investigate any underlying trends of sentiment across specific countries, answering questions like: Are the British people more inclined to be in favour of their traditional agent due to his origin? How does the Americans position themselves against a blockbuster that does not belong to their Hollywood system?
